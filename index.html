        <p>Portfolio Development: <br><br>
          • I have designed and developed a web development portfolio, which serves as a
          showcase of my skills and experience. This portfolio likely includes information
          about myself, projects i have worked on, my skills, and contact information. <br><br>
          Technologies Used:<br><br>
          •I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the portfolio. HTML is used for
          structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity
          and dynamic elements.<br><br>
          Hosting on GitHub Pages:<br><br>
          •I have hosted the portfolio on GitHub Pages. This is a free hosting service provided
          by GitHub, which allows you to publish web pages directly from a GitHub
          repository. It provides a convenient way to share my portfolio with potential
          employers and clients.<br><br>
          GitHub Desktop:<br><br>
          •I have used GitHub Desktop, a desktop application provided by GitHub, to update
          and manage my portfolio. It is a user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of
          version control and collaboration with GitHub repositories.
          By developing and maintaining the portfolio using these technologies and tools, I have
          demonstrated the ability to create functional and visually appealing web pages. It also
          shows my proficiency in using version control to manage and update the codebase.
          This will help potential employers and clients assess my skills and experience in web
          development.</p>

        <p>
          Objective: <br><br>
•The primary goal was to build a calculator application that allows users to perform
basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The emphasis was on providing a responsive web design to ensure that the calculator
functions seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and
mobile phones.<br><br>
Responsive Web Design:<br><br>
•The calculator's interface was designed to adapt and scale according to the screen
size of the device being used. This ensured that users could perform calculations
comfortably and efficiently, regardless of the device they were using. The responsive
design allowed for a consistent and user-friendly experience across different
platforms.<br><br>
User-friendly and Intuitive Interface:<br><br>
•The calculator's interface was designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Clear and
concise buttons for numbers, operators, and functions were implemented, allowing
users to input and modify calculations effortlessly. Additionally, a visually appealing
and coherent color scheme was used to enhance the user experience.<br><br>
Rapid Calculations On-the-Go:<br><br>
•The aim was to provide users with a handy tool for quick calculations, eliminating
the need to carry a physical calculator. By leveraging the calculator's responsive
design, users could conveniently access and utilize the application on their preferred
devices whenever and wherever they needed.<br><br>
Deployment and Accessibility:<br><br>
•Once the development phase was completed, the calculator application was deployed,
making it accessible to users. The deployment could have been achieved using
various methods such as hosting the application on a web server or utilizing a cloud
platform. The goal was to ensure that users could easily access and benefit from the<br><br>
calculator's functionality.<br><br>
By successfully completing this project, I have demonstrated the ability to develop a
responsive web application, implement user-friendly interfaces, and deliver a practical
solution to a specific problem. These skills are valuable for future web development
endeavors and showcase the proficiency in front-end development, design, and usability
considerations.

      <div class="contactinform portfolio trans">
        <p>
          Stopwatch Development: <br><br>
•The main objective was to create a functional stopwatch application using web
development technologies. HTML was used to structure the content of the
stopwatch, CSS was employed for styling and layout, and JavaScript provided the
necessary functionality to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.<br><br>
Deployment on GitHub:<br><br>
• Once the development phase was completed, the stopwatch application was deployed
on GitHub. This means that the source code and related files were hosted on a
GitHub repository, making it publicly accessible through GitHub Pages. Users can
visit the deployed application's URL to interact with the stopwatch directly.<br><br>
GitHub Desktop for Repository Management:<br><br>
•GitHub Desktop, a desktop application provided by GitHub, was utilized to update
and manage the project's repository. This tool simplifies the process of version
control by providing a user-friendly interface for performing Git operations. It allows
for easy management of branches, commits, and code synchronization between local
and remote repositories.<br><br>
Proficiency in Web Development Technologies:<br><br>
• By successfully developing the stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, I have demonstrated proficiency in these core web development
technologies. HTML is used to structure the content, CSS for styling and layout, and
JavaScript for adding interactivity and functionality to the stopwatch.
Effective Utilization of GitHub:<br><br>
•The utilization of GitHub and GitHub Desktop showcases your ability to leverage
version control and repository management tools effectively. By using Git for version
control, I have demonstrated an understanding of collaborative software development
practices and the ability to track changes, manage branches, and collaborate with
others on the project.<br><br>
Overall, this project highlights the skills in web development and showcases my ability
to create a functional application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, the
usage of GitHub and GitHub Desktop demonstrates with proficiency in version control
and repository management, which are essential skills for collaborative software
development.

      <div class="contactinform portfolio trans">
        <p>
          The Dynamic Background Color Changer project allows users to input a color value
          and dynamically change the background color of a specified element based on the
          entered color. The project provides an interactive user interface where users can input
          their desired color using a color picker or a text input field.<br><br>
          Key Features:<br><br>
          •Color Input: <br>Users can input a color value by typing the color value manually into a
          text input field.<br>
          •Background Color Change:<br> Upon submitting the color input, the project dynamically
          changes the background color of a specific element to the entered color.<br>
          •Color Validation: <br>The project performs basic validation to ensure that a valid color
          value is entered. If an invalid color value is provided, previous color is displayed to
          the user.<br>
          •Clear and Focus:<br> After each submission, the input field is cleared, and the focus is
          automatically set back to the input field, ready for the next color selection.
          Technologies Used:<br>
          •HTML: <br>Used to structure the user interface and define the input fields and elements.<br>
          •JavaScript: <br>Implemented the logic to handle user input, validate the color value, and
          perform the background color change.<br>
